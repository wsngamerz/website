#### Hey there, you seem to have stumbled upon my about page!

I'll give a brief intoduction as to who I am.

Hi, my name is William Neild and I am an A level student. I currently study Maths, Computer Science and Physics and I
enjoy Computer Science the most.

I am a self taught developer and technology nerd, loving basically anything which has a processor or involves some
technological process and finally, my dream career is probably within the software development industry as I love
to program.

P.S I have a fair amount of experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript (es6+ browser and nodejs), Python, SQL and C#.
