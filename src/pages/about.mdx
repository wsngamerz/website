Hey there, my name is William Neild and I am a Software Developer.

I first got into software development when I was in my early teens when I was
introduced to the Raspberry Pi, A small single-board computer designed to
teach children about the power of computing, and well, that seemed to work
given that almost 8 years later, I am a second-year undergraduate student at
the University of Leeds, studying Computer Science.

Throughout the past few years, I have worked on a large number of projects,
including TapZ, LightningChat, Stepmania Server, and most recently, DataViewer.
These projects although not specifically designed for the general public, were
designed to not only be a side project to work on in my spare time, but to push
myself to become a better software developer by learning new languages,
libraries and professional programming techniques.

Although I have basic experience in a range of programming languages such as C,
Python and C#, my prefered programming language of choice is JavaScript (with a
sprinkle of TypeScript too). This is because I believe that the future of
applications lies within the web browser, which funnily enough, uses JS, and
it's also got a nice backend runtime. One language to run everywhere!

Now, if that's not enough for you, then you can contact me <Link to="/contact">here</Link>,
or you could even check out some of my public projects <Link to="/projects">here</Link>.
