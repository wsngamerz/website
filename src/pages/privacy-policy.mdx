Your privacy is important to me. It is my (William Neild's) policy to respect your privacy regarding any information I
may collect from you across the website, https://williamneild.com, and other sites I own and operate.

I only ask for personal information when I truly need it to provide a service to you. I collect it by fair and
lawful means, with your knowledge and consent. I also let you know why I'm collecting it and how it will be used.

I only retain collected information for as long as necessary to provide you with your requested service. What data I
store, I’ll protect within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorised access,
disclosure, copying, use or modification.

I don’t share any personally identifying information publicly or with third-parties, except when required to by law.

My website may link to external sites that are not operated by me. Please be aware that I have no control over the
content and practices of these sites, and cannot accept responsibility or liability for their respective privacy
policies.

You are free to refuse my request for your personal information, with the understanding that I may be unable to
provide you with some of your desired services.

#### External Tools

###### Google Analytics

I have integrated Google Analytics (with anonymisation function) on this website.

Google Analytics is a web analytics service. Web analysis is the gathering, collection and analysis of data about the
behavior of visitors to websites. Among other things, a web analysis service collects data on which website a data
subject has come to a website from (so-called referrers), which subpages of the website were accessed or how often and
for which period of time a subpage was viewed. A web analysis is mainly used to optimize a website and for the
cost-benefit analysis of Internet advertising.

The operator of Google Analytics is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.

Google Analytics uses cookies. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually
transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. Google might transfer the personal information collected
via this technical procedure to third parties.

As IP anonymization is activated on our website, your IP address will be shortened by Google within Member States of
the European Union or other states in agreement with the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases, the full
IP address is sent to and shortened by a Google server in the USA. On behalf of the operator of the website, Google
will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, compile reports on website activity and to provide
further services related to website and internet use to me. The IP address transferred through your browser to Google
Analytics will not be combined with other data held by Google.

In addition, this website uses the Analytics feature UserID to track interaction data. This User ID will be
additionally anonymized and encrypted and will not be linked with other data.

You can prevent the storage of cookies by a corresponding setting of your browser software; however, please note that
if you do this, you may not be able to use all the features of this website to the fullest extent possible.

In addition, you may prevent the collection of the data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website
(including your IP address) by Google as well as the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing
the browser plug-in available under the following link: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout

This browser add-on informs Google Analytics via JavaScript that no data and information about website visits may be
transmitted to Google Analytics.

In addition, a cookie already set by Google Analytics can be deleted at any time via the Internet browser or other
software programs.

Further information and Google‘s applicable privacy regulations can be found at https://policies.google.com/privacy and
https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/ The following link provides a further explanation of Google Analytics
https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/.

My website also uses Google Analytics performance reports relating to demographics and interests and reports on Google
Display Network impressions. You can disable Google Analytics for display advertising and customize the ads on the
Google Display Network by visiting the ad settings at this link: https://adssettings.google.com.

###### Conclusion

Your continued use of my website will be regarded as acceptance of our practices around privacy and personal
information. If you have any questions about how I handle user data and personal information, feel free to
[contact](/contact) me.

This policy is effective as of 13 May 2020.
